[HudPixelReloaded](https://github.com/unaussprechlich/HudPixelExtendedl)

The repository contains parts of [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge) and it's dependencies. These parts have their licenses under forge-docs/. These parts can be downloaded at [files.minecraftforge.net](http://files.minecraftforge.net).
Parts of the code are based upon the [Hypixel Public API](https://github.com/HypixelDev/PublicAPI). These parts are all in src/main/java/net/hypixel/api and subdirectories and have a special copyright header. Unfortunately they are missing a license but they are obviously intended for usage in this kind of application.
The original version of the [HudPixel Mod](https://github.com/palechip/HudPixel) is made by palechip and published under the MIT license.
The ported version to Minecraft 1.8.9/1.9 [HudPixel Reloaded](https://github.com/PixelModders/HudPixel) is made by PixelModders/Eladkay and also published under the MIT license (to be changed to the new license as detailed below in the next minor update).

For the rest of the code and for the build the following license applies:

HudPixel Reloaded License (by Eladkay)

TL;DR: don't repost, the mod isn't yours, don't sell it.

I don't like lengthy legal licenses, so I'll make it simple.
1. You are allowed to download the mod and its sources and change them however you like.
2. Don't distribute any copy of the mod unless you have made changes to the source and a Pull Request on GitHub was made to attempt to push the changes into the main repository. In that case, send it to Eladkay, Unaussprechilich as a conversation in Hypixel.net.
3. Don't claim any of the code is yours. It's not. Unless you made a Pull Request that was merged, in which case, I suppose some of it is. Still, even if you made a thousand PRs that were merged, the only authors for the mod are PixelModders (especially palechip) and Unaussprechilich.
4. Don't sell any copy of the mod. Even if you're just selling a link to the original download. You're not allowed to charge access to the mod. The mod will always be free.
5. PixelModders is allowed to change the license at their discretion. 
6. This license is void for members of PixelModders and to Unaussprechilich, except for clauses 5, and of course 6.
