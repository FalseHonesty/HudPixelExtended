    "2": "- new config system, all commented, all fast, using the power of KOTLIN. you might want to delete your existing config file. for now the config gui is absent.",
    "3": "- so, here's the deal. java is cool, but everyone writes mods in java. there's this cool new language called KOTLIN that does a lot of cool things. eventually me and @unaussprechlich want to convert the entire mod to KOTLIN but for now the new config system is kotlin",
    "4": "- work on @unaussprechlich's managed gui lib",
    "5": "- began work on a skyclash system that is cool",
    "6": "- removed palechip's game system. with the new game detector and config system, there is no longer a need for the pain in the butt that system was. you will notice a significant decrease in the amount of caps you use and probably an improvement in performance, too.",
    "7": "- honestly probably a lot more but i'm not looking through 150+ files of diff just so you can be grateful lolk"
