# HudPixel Mod
### An unofficial client-side Minecraft modification designed for the Hypixel Network.

This modification was written as an entry to the [Hypixel's Got Talent Contest](http://hypixel.net/threads/hypixels-got-talent.126629/).
It's goal is to provide you with useful information while playing on Hypixel Network. It is designed to be stable and lightweight.

 __Features__
 * Coin Counter (Displays your total amount of coins as you are playing)
 * Timer (Displays the time since the game has started)
 * Mega Walls Kill Counter (Counts and displays the amount of people you kill in Mega walls)
 * Blitz Star Tracker (Displays who currently has the blitz star, what Blitz was activated and how long it is active)
 * Blitz Deathmatch Notifier (Helps you not to miss when the deathmatch is going to start)
 * Arena Powerup Highlighter (Shows when a powerup has spawned so you don't rely on seeing the chat message)
 * Paintball Killstreak Timer (Tells you when your killstreak is going to run out)
 * Highly configurable (Check the file inside the config folder in your minecraft directory)
 
 (Please note that the coin counter and the timer are only active if you can't get the information form the scoreboard.)

 __Todo__
 * Update Notifier
 * Better Rendering
 * Implement all Arcade Games (they will only receive Coin counters and Timers)

 __Contributing__
 The mod is going to be open source. (I have yet to choose a license.) Feel free to open a pull request but please understand that I won't merge anything until the contest is over so that the mod stays my own work.
